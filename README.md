### Hi there 👋 

#### I'm Srishti Singh! 

- 🔭 I’m currently pursuing my Masters in Analytics
- 📚 I'm currently focusing on mastering Salesforce Business analytics.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Despite being deeply immersed in the world of data analytics and technology, I also have a passion for exploring new cuisines 🍲 and I'am known among friends and colleagues as a connoisseur of exotic foods. Whether it's trying out the latest fusion restaurant in town or experimenting with cooking recipes from different cultures, I enjoy the adventure of culinary exploration as much as I do unraveling complex data puzzles
